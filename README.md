# ReactCourse
React course I took in 2024 in order to get up to date in all the new offerings in the framework.

#Reason

I get a lot of backend and devops experience already in my work, but not as much front end lately. I'm taking this course to stay up to date, and documenting progress with github to motivate me to finish.
